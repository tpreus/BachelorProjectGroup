# BachelorProjectGroup
This program was developed during the bachelor project "Elastic shape matching" at the University of Bonn.

The program requires:
gptoolbox (https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox)
YALMIP (https://yalmip.github.io/), download and add to matlab path
Gurobi (https://www.gurobi.com/solutions/gurobi-optimizer/), download, obtain licens and add to matlab path
Mosek (https://www.mosek.com/) download, obtain licens and add to matlab path (optional)
the feature calculation is adopted from Emanuele Rodol√†

The program presents an approach to the three dimensional shape matching problem by placing points of mesh Y on the surface of mesh X. 
A mixed integer linear optimization problem with different constraints is implemented

The frame.m file is an example application to the problem

The getConstraints.m file takes the X and Y meshes and a vector indicating which constraints to compute, and returns the matrix A and vector b for optimization
The getObjectiveFunction.m file takes the meshes X and Y and their feature vectors and returns the objective vector c for the optimization.

The problem min c^t x s.t. Ax \leq b is then optimized in frame.m

getCoordinated.m takes mesh X and Y and the values x from the optimization program and returns a list of coordinates [x,y,z] for the points of Y on the surface from x
